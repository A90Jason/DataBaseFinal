# DataBaseFinal
Database Final Project
## Goal

Develop a book order/request website: professors create book-request lists and send them to staff to print and submit to the Bookstore.

### Staff tasks:

- Log in to the system as a super admin (i.e., the first admin user) using a predefined password
- Create a new admin account with a temporary password for another staff, or delete an existing admin account
- Change the password as needed
- Create and maintain the faculty database that includes at least their name and email address
- Broadcast an email to request the professors to submit their book requests by a certain deadline
- The system automatically broadcasts a reminder email by a specified date
- Send an invitation email to a professor to request book information (e.g., an individual reminder)
- Create the final list of book requests for the upcoming semester (for submission to the bookstore)
- View the list of requests for a given semester (including the upcoming semester)

### Professor tasks:

- When receiving an invitation email to make book requests, click on a URL provided in the email to log in to the book order website. The following two situations may happen:
    1) Create a new account if this is the first time using this website
    2) Request a temporary password in order to change the current password if forgotten
- The first form, after login, asks if the professor wants to submit a new book request form, or view and edit an existing form.
- Fill out a new online book request form. For each class, enter the following order information for each book: (1) book title, (2) author names, (3) edition, (4) publisher, (5) ISBN. The system maintains only one request form for each professor for a given semester.
- View and edit the existing request form
    1) Delete one or more books from the current request form
    2) Add one or more books to the current request form
    3) Delete the current request form (This allows creation of a new form)

## Requirements

- Each team member demonstrates the pages they developed
- Submission of a design document (with all members signing the document) to Webcourses explaining:
    1) the software development environment
    2) the database design
    3) division of work among the team members
    4) meeting attendance
- Each team member submits a confidential scoring of the other team mates; a missing score is interpreted as a zero
- A zip folder of the project files submitted to Webcourses
